            <p>What you may not have known is that before
            before becoming a  web developer I held positions as
            varied as welder, program director, and educator. </p>
            <p>This past has allowed me to develop excellent
            interpersonal sensibilities, and an aptitude
            for abstract reasoning and creativity.</p>
            <p>Iâ€™ve always loved to create. Now I do that
            through code. I do collaborative full stack development
            with an intent toward elegance in technology and design.</p>
          <p>I also love to hike, eat, and read.</p>

It's a chatroom in which groups can chat in private rooms with their friends, but each person's identity is anonymous. The idea is that you know the people in your room are your friends, but you don't know exactly who's saying what. The primary technologies I used in the site were Node.JS, Express, Socket.io, and PostgreSQL.",
